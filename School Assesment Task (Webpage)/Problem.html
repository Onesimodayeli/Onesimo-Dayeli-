  <h1 class="section-title" >What is the current situation facing IoT and financial privacy/online transactions? </h1>
 
<p>Society today is focused too much on financial gain but not the hardworking way, more like a get rich quick way.
 This makes them more prone to scams as there are people who have mastered the art of technological manipulation. 
 These people use various programs and write down thousands of lines of code all in hopes that one victim will be willing to take the bait.
 To understand how these hackers/programmers think, you have to understand what they do, what they use and what is the end goal.
 There are 5 main online scams that you get namely: Fake antivirus software, phishing, Technical support scam, Fake shopping scams
 and Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency scams. Underneath you will find information on how these malicious sites or programs work and a brief 
 description on trojans and their purposes. Besides online scams, we as people also make mistakes and canâ€™t rectify our mistakes quick 
 enough which could therefore lead to a data breach. These mistakes may include a variety of either carefully planned ideas to ruin a company 
 or a simple mistake done without any malice intent. In this part of the practical assignment we will switch our focus to the questions and 
 sources table and answer the questions that were asked in attempt to find the solution to the problem we faced. (PhriendlyPhishing, 2022)</p></br>
<h2>What is a trojan</h2>
<p>A Trojan is known as a harmful application that poses as trustworthy software. The Trojan horse tale is where the phrase first appeared in 
literature. The Greeks left a huge wooden horse filled with Greek soldiers outside Troy during their conflict with the Trojans. The horse was 
taken inside the city gates by the Trojans, who mistook it for a gift. As soon as it got dark, the Greek troops got off the horse and unlocked
 the city's gates, letting the Greek army plunder the place. Similar to this, trojan programs trick users into installing them by making them 
 seem intriguing or useful when, in reality, they are dangerous. Either a Trojan can be attached to beneficial software, or a hacker can deceive 
 you into believing the Trojan is useful software. (Kapersky, 2020).</p></br>

<h2>What are the risks of financial transactions online?</h2>
</br>
<b><h2>Fake antivirus software</h2></b>
<h2>Antivirus: What is it? </h2>
<p>Antivirus software looks for, finds, and eliminates viruses as well as other harmful programs like worms, trojan horses, adware, and more. 
This software is designed to be used as a preventative measure for online security to thwart threats before they can damage your machine. 
While you may believe that your computer is secure as long as you avoid visiting dubious websites, hackers actually employ many more subtle methods to 
infect your PCs, necessitating the usage of a powerful antivirus program to stay one step ahead of them. The results of a virus entering your computer 
could be fatal. Numerous types of malicious behaviour can result from viruses. They have the ability to destroy your device, monitor your personal 
accounts, or spy on you using your camera. Viruses can be used by hackers to steal your personal data, including account logins and financial data. The 
use of this can then be made for identity theft, phishing scams, and other crimes. Network protection is now more crucial than ever because of these 
potential repercussions. (Support, 2020)</p></br>
<h2>How do Antiviruses work</h2>
<p>Incoming data or code that is being sent through your network traffic is scanned by antivirus software. Companies that create this software collect a 
sizable library of existing viruses and malware and train the program to recognize, flag, and eliminate them. The antivirus searches its database for matches
 as files, programs, and apps come into and go from your computer. Isolated, scanned, and eliminated are matches that are the same as or similar to the database.
 You can configure your antivirus software to automatically scan your computer for dangerous files, but you can also choose to perform manual scans, which allow 
 you to sit back and watch as malicious files are identified and eliminated. The results of a virus entering your computer could be fatal. Numerous types of 
 malicious behaviour can result from viruses. They have the ability to destroy your device, monitor your personal accounts, or spy on you using your camera.
Viruses can be used by hackers to steal your personal data, including account logins and financial data. The use of this can then be made for identity theft, 
phishing scams, and other crimes. Network protection is now more crucial than ever because of these potential repercussions.</p></br>
<h2>Fake Antiviruses </h2>
<p>First off, your fake antivirus will either be modified legal antivirus software or fake antivirus software created entirely from scratch by a small business 
you've probably never heard of.
Naturally, avoid using The Pirate Bay to download antivirus software. Buy it. And acquire an antivirus made by a respected brand from a reputable retailer.
When identifying a fake antivirus program, you need to know both the behaviour of the junk software and the garbage that it installs on your computer, 
such as malware, viruses, crypto-miners, etc., are at play here. Even though they might be related to the same issue, while trying to spot fraudulent 
antivirus software, they are separate elements.</p>
</br>
<p>What I mean is that any malware, viruses, or other threats you wind up having on your system would essentially act the same way they would if your computer 
had been attacked using a method other than a phony antivirus program. Therefore, all of the problems that these can lead to, including browser redirects 
changing your homepage (yeah, they're still around in 2020), lock-ups, slowdowns, rogue processes running, numerous trash pop-up advertising showing, strange 
toolbars adding to your browser, etc., could indicate that your antivirus program is terrible. Or not. There's a significant likelihood the two are connected 
if you already know you installed a bogus antivirus. Even if they are unrelated if you are certain that you did not install such software, you should still use 
reputable antivirus software to address the issue.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to avoid antivirus malware:</p>
<p>
Use a firewall - Incoming firewalls are incorporated into all popular operating systems. Activate it.
Never click pop-up windows. Actually, no. Never. Don't do it at all.
You should pay attention and find the information you need elsewhere if your browser issues a warning about a website you are trying to access.
Never download software that has been illegally obtained. Free items may seem alluring, but keep in mind that the people who upload them are frequently out to make money, either by infecting your system directly or by selling your information to other online criminals.
Only purchase authentic security software from reputable vendors.
Viruses can be mailed, therefore it's always a good idea to scan all of your incoming mail with an antivirus tool. Only open email attachments from senders you trust and can verify their identity. (Dahan, 2020)

<h2>Phishing</h2>
<p>Phishing is a form of social engineering assault that is frequently employed to obtain user information, such as login credentials and credit card details. 
It happens when an attacker deceives a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message by disguising themselves as a reliable source. 
Next, a dangerous link is deceived into being clicked by the recipient. This can cause malware to be installed on the recipient's computer, a ransomware assault to 
lock it down, or the disclosure of private data. 
In contrast to phishing that targets random application users, spear phishing targets a specific individual or company. It's a more sophisticated form of phishing 
that necessitates in-depth familiarity with an organization, including its hierarchy.</p></br>
<h2>A possible attack scenario is as follows:</h2>
<p>A culprit looks for the identities of personnel in the marketing division of a company and acquires access to the most recent project bills.
 Attacker contacts a departmental project manager (PM) as the marketing director while using the subject line Updated invoice for Q3 campaigns. 
 The language, formatting, and attached logo are all identical to the organization's default email template. The email contains a link that leads to a password-protected 
 internal document that is actually a fake invoice. To access the document, the PM is asked to log in. After stealing his credentials, the attacker gains complete access 
 to the organization's network's sensitive sections. Spear phishing is a useful technique for carrying out the initial step of an APT since it can give an attacker legitimate 
 login credentials.</p></br>
<h2>Fake shopping websites</h2>


<p>The most recent Technology is used by scammers to create phony retailer websites that imitate real online retail establishments. They might utilize complex layouts and designs, 
possibly stolen logos, even .com domain name. The primary red flag that a retail website is fraudulent is the payment method. If you submit your money this way, it's doubtful that 
you will receive your order or see your money again. Scammers sometimes request payment via money order, pre-loaded money card, or wire transfer.</p></br>
<h2>Internet auction houses</h2>
<p>The majority of online auction services, like eBay, have strong rules to prevent fraud against their clients. Because of this, con artists frequently 
attempt to convince victims to sign a contract outside of the auction site. Scammers could tell you the item is for sale after they say the auction's winner
 withdrew after you placed a bid. You won't hear from them again once they have your money, and the auction site won't be able to assist you.</p></br>
<h2>Web-based classified ads</h2>
<p>Online marketplaces that advertise the sale of products and services permit price negotiations between potential buyers and sellers off the website. 
Scammers can publish phony adverts for everything, including rental homes, pets, used cars, boats, bikes, caravans, and horses, while disguising themselves as legitimate merchants. 
The scammers may list things at a price that is far less than similar items listed on the same website. These frauds are categorized as classified. Scammers may even pretend to be 
buyers in order to send you a check for more money than is necessary to purchase an item, then demand a refund for the difference. Scams involving overpayments are these. (
Government of Western Australia, 2022)</p></br>
<h2>Technical support scam</h2>

<b><h2>Where tech support scams started</h2></b>
<p>The majority of people believe that professionals working in a noisy boiler room in some foreign country work on tech support scams (also known as bogus Microsoft support cold 
calls), and they are not mistaken. Tech support frauds can be traced back to Mumbai, Kolkata, or other locations in India. Around 2008, the first reports of these tech support scams
 (TSS) arose, and they have steadily gained ground since then. 2013 saw a sharp increase in TSS cases as con artists started to employ malicious advertising to spread false alarms. 
 The Internet Crime Complaint Centre, often known as IC3, released a PSA about the new digital twist on tech support scams a year later to inform Internet users, encourage the 
 public to report incidents, and advise them to exercise caution. Digital tech support frauds became well known not long after, and big tech corporations started to defend themselves
 . Microsoft openly sued a number of businesses, including one in India, in December 2014, claiming that they had misrepresented themselves as offering technical assistance services 
 connected to Microsoft. Additionally, the FTC began to make some significant strides in 2015 in its efforts to aid and defend both consumers and IT corporations. 
 They announced the closure of many tech support con artists who impersonated Apple, Microsoft, and Google Tech Support and took close to $17 million from consumers in November of 
 that year. But the battle has only just begun. Tech support scams have developed since the FTC's first significant victory, and they continue to defraud customers of millions of 
 dollars each year. (malwarebytes, 2022)</p></br>
<h2>How to identify tech support scams </h2>
<p>1.	Phone calls
Scammers posing as computer technicians from well-known companies could phone and ask for technical support. They claim to have identified an issue with your machine. They frequently demand remote access to your computer before pretending to perform a diagnostic test. Then they try to charge you for fixing a false problem. Hear an undercover FTC agent converse with a tech support con artist. Hang up if someone calls you unexpectedly and claims that your computer is having a problem.</p>
<p>2.	Pop-up cautions
Scammers posing as tech help may attempt to seduce you by popping up a window on your computer screen. It could use logos from reputable businesses or websites
 and appear to be an error message from your operating system or antivirus software. The window's message alerts you to a security problem with your computer 
 and directs you to call a phone number for assistance. (Federal Trade Comission, 2019)</p></br>
<h2>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency scams</h2>
<h2>How the Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency scams work</h2></br>
<p>1.	Schemes for investing in bitcoin</br>
Scammers approach participants in bitcoin investment schemes under the pretence of being seasoned "investment managers." As part of the scam, the so-called 
investment managers make extravagant claims about their success investing in cryptocurrencies and assure their victims that their investments will be profitable.
 The con artists demand a payment up front to begin. The crooks then simply steal the upfront payments rather than make money. In order to access someone's cryptocurrency,
 the con artists may also ask for personal identity information under the pretence that they need it to transfer or deposit money.
The use of phony celebrity endorsements is a different kind of investment scam. In order to make it seem as though the celebrity is endorsing a significant 
financial benefit from the investment, scammers take authentic images and superimpose them on false accounts, advertising, or articles. These assertions come 
from sources that seem credible because they use well-known brand names like ABC or CBS and have polished websites and logos. But the endorsement is a fraud.</p></br>

<p>2.	Bitcoin giveaway fraud on social media</br>
Social media sites are flooded with fake posts that advertise bitcoin giveaways. To entice consumers, some of these scams also use phony celebrity accounts to
 promote the offer. However, when a user clicks on the promotion, they are transferred to a phony website that requests verification in order to send them 
 bitcoin. Making a payment as part of the verification process demonstrates the legitimacy of the account. The victim runs the risk of losing this payment or,
 even worse, clicking on a malicious link that results in the theft of their personal data and bitcoin.</p></br>
<p>3.	Inauthentic cryptocurrency exchanges</br>
Investors may fall for scams that offer a fantastic cryptocurrency exchange or even more free bitcoin. The investor does not realize it is a scam until after they have lost their deposit, however, as there is no exchange in actuality. Because cryptocurrency runs outside of banking institutions and uses blockchain for verification, it is more difficult to recover from theft. To avoid using a new exchange, stick to well-known ones like Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Cash App. Before entering any personal information, do some research and look up the reputation and legitimacy of the exchange on industry websites.
Human errors that could lead to a breach of information</p></br>

<p>With technology you can never be safe enough and have full confidence in the safety of your private information. Because even if you can encrypt your 
information with the highest level of encryption there is always a chance that a human could make an error. These errors can be:</p>
<p>1.	Weak passwords</br>
2.	use of software that is outdated or not secure, </br>
3.	low security awareness, </br>
4.	letting an unauthorised person access a company device.</br>
5.	Ineffective Data Access Management.</br></p>
</br>
<p>The results that follow after any one of these is used maliciously are immense. They can cost a company a fortune or even be the cause of bankruptcy.
<b>Here are a few examples.</b></p>
<h2>1.	Income Loss</h2>
<p>Security breaches can result in significant income loss. According to studies, 29% of companies that have a data breach suffer revenue losses. 
38% of those who faced revenue losses did so by a margin of 20% or more. For instance, a broken website might lead potential customers to look elsewhere. 
However, any IT system outage might cause delays at the office.</p>
<h2>2.	Brand reputation damage</h2>
<p>More than just your immediate financial situation can be affected by a security breach. Your brand's long-term reputation is also in jeopardy. 
You don't necessarily want your emails to be exposed, for one. Most of the time, you need to keep these emails secret. Customers appreciate their privacy 
as well, though, and breaches frequently involve financial information from customers. Prospective customers won't be willing to put their trust in a company 
with a track record of lax data protection.</p>
<h2>3.	 Intellectual Property Loss</h2>
<p>It can be disastrous to lose revenue and destroy one's reputation. Hackers, however, occasionally target blueprints, plans, and strategies. 
Construction and manufacturing companies are more vulnerable to this threat. Smaller companies frequently think they won't be impacted. But small 
firms are the target of 60% of hackers. This is because it's simpler to assault them. Losing intellectual property may reduce your company's ability 
to compete. Some competitors wouldn't think twice about using stolen information to their advantage.</p>
<h2>4.  Unknown Costs</h2>
<p>The first charges are at the surface level. There are also a lot of unintended expenses associated with breaches. For instance, legal costs might be
 a factor. Along with increased costs for PR and investigations, there may also be increases in insurance premiums. Another truth that many companies ignore
 are regulatory sanctions. As an illustration, the FCC fined AT&T $25 million in 2015. This came about as a result of a breach that exposed data pertaining 
 to thousands of accounts.</p>
<h2>5. Cyberbullying</h2>
<p>Some hackers like to play practical jokes on people. In such circumstances, a security breach may just necessitate minor word modifications on your website.
 Even while it appears to be rather harmless, this can actually do a lot of harm. Smaller changes are more difficult to see. On your contact page, for instance,
 ker might replace a few characters or numbers. Some of your websites can also get vulgar content added by them. (theamegroup, 2022)</p>
